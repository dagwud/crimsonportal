     * Each player has "friendly" enemies who don't attack him, only the other player(s)
   * One-on-one: Lone Ranger
     * Enemies go for whoever they like; each player tries to survive as long as possible
     * Players can be killed be enemies and by each other

  * Bombers (explode when shot, or when near player, causing damage to all nearby units)
    * Player can then shoot bombers in order to destroy other enemies ;)

 * Land-mines
